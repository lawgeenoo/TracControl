# TracControl
TC toggling simulation. (for self educating)

This is just a basic exercise for self educating in C and modular programming using Makefile.
So far works as intended, no known bugs. Might add features later.

Basically, it's how the TC system on my car works. 

Can be toggled on/off under 60 km/h.
If off, can be toggled on above 60km/h, but not off again, unless under 60km/h.
